Breakout is an arcade game developed by Atari Inc. and introduced on May 13, 1976. In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed.
