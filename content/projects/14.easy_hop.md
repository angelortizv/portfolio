[Easy Hop](https://www.easyhop.co/) is the only platform in Costa Rica that connects private group shuttles with visitors in both rural, and touristic destinations. Within the project I was in charge of developing the mobile application for drivers, whose main function was to see the stopping points on a map and validate passenger tickets.
