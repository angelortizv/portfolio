Table tennis is a fast-paced and dynamic sport where coaches, players and analysts require accurate tools to assess performance in real-time. The absence of advanced systems that can process and analyse high-resolution video to detect critical events such as ball bounces and net hits limits usersâ€™ ability to make informed decisions. TopspinAI addresses this need by providing an automated system that uses artificial intelligence for ball detection and semantic segmentation, improving analysis and decision making during matches.
